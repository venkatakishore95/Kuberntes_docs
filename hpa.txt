You can perform HPA on a Cluster created using KOPS or AWS EKS.
If you use AWS EKS, metric sever needs to be enabled by using the following
command.

https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/eks-metrics-server-pod-autoscaler/

To install Metrics Server, run the following command:
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/download/v0.3.6/components.yaml

To confirm that Metrics Server is running, run the following command:
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=metrics-server

For keeping a default load usig stress using sreeharshav/stress:256M.
This will increase the POD count but will not decrease as the stress 
will run default on the pods. Its good to test this. You can find the
CMD running on the pod using docker inspect image <imagename>.

For testing the HPA use the image sreeharshav/utils:latest

================================================================================
For Cluster created with KOPS, following steps need to be performed:

https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/metrics-server

kops edit cluster

add configuration below to your cluster configuration under kubelet:
kubelet:
    anonymousAuth: false
    authorizationMode: Webhook
    authenticationTokenWebhook: true

kops update cluster --yes
kops rolling-update cluster --yes

First the master is going to be terminated & redeployed.
Later new nodes will be deployed and old nodes terminated.

Below command will give error because of DEployment API version. Use the file kops-metrics.yaml in the drive.

Create a nginx deployment with one replica and also service
kubectl autoscale deployment nginx --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=10

--horizontal-pod-autoscaler-downscale-stabilization

root@ip-192-168-1-100:~/clusters# ku get hpa
NAME    REFERENCE          TARGETS   MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE

Need to deploy a lot of things to achive this. Better to check it in EKS or AKS using cluster autoscalrer
